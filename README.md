# alien-attack-game
My first graphical Python game, similar to Space Invaders

- Creates a fleet of aliens for the player to shoot before the aliens reach the bottom of the screen
- Aliens shoot back based on a random trigger
- Each time the player clears the wave, a new fleet appears, the speed is increased and the points per alien shot increases
- Includes game stats, including a score counter and saves high scores to a txt file
- Includes a starfield generator to draw an endless scrolling starfield as the background
- Based largely on the "Alien Invasion" project from the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes
